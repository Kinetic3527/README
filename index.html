    The American Dream Isn't Possible
   
   What does a perfect life look like? Everyone has a different answer to that question. But why doesn’t everybody live this dream life of theirs? What would it take to achieve this dream? The American dream is unattainable because of classism, racism, stereotypes, and discrimination. These four factors can alter a person's life and stop them from achieving the American Dream.
       Classism is the idea that people should be treated differently based on their economic standing. To aid my point J.D. Vance author of “Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a family and Culture in  Crisis” tells the readers how his family lived and the struggles they went through. “My family Struggled with abuse, alcoholism, and trauma. We lived in the middle class…”. Vance believed that his family had gone through everyday struggles that the majority of the middle class went through. J.D. Vance believed that he was living in poor conditions along with his family. This shows a man living in the middle class with his family and the struggles they had to go through. To explore more on this J.D. Vance also tells us how “I just wanted reassurance. ‘Mamaw, does God love us?’ she hung her head, gave me a hug, and began to cry”. Young J.D. Vance believed that they were living so terribly that he had to ask his grandmother  that question, and his grandmother felt bad so she decided not to answer the question and instead dodge it. Vance showed how he lived a poor life in a poor community. This shows how living poorly affected Vance’s mindset.
   
       The American Dream is unachievable because of racism. Racism is a person’s personal bias toward a certain race/group of people. Toni Cade Bambara Teaches a young group of kids about how the color of their skin can dictate a part of their life. In the article “ The Lesson” by Toni Cade Bambara, Miss Moore informs on how different their life is from the lives of rich people's lives when one of her students named “QT” exclaims “Must be rich white people who shop here”. Bambara believed that her students needed to see the difference in how different groups of people lived and notice their race. This shows how race can affect one's lifestyle and majorly affect their way of achieving the American Dream. This proves that there is a clear race issue when it comes to achieving the American dream. To further aid my perspective, Joslyn Armstrong, one of the many writers of the article “A Dream Deferred: How Discrimination Impacts the American Dream Achievement for African Americans”, is explaining how history has had an effect on the American dream and explains “For much of American history, African Americans have been traditionally excluded from the promises of the American Dream”. Armstrong believes that African Americans have had a setback in education for obvious reasons such as segregation, slavery, etc. This shows how race plays a huge part in how the American Dream is unattainable.
       Stereotyping can affect how a person achieves the American Dream by setting unjust opinions and ideas about a group of people. Zaid Jilani, author of the article “How to Beat Stereotypes by Seeing People as Individuals” believes that stereotypes can affect people’s course of life. He interprets in great detail how “ Also, it is true that not everyone can achieve the American Dream. When people picture a family living the American Dream, they usually picture a stereotypical white family, and do not open up about the idea of the American Dream to different races or ethnicities”. Jilani shows us his thoughts by giving us an example of most people's thoughts when they hear the phrase American dream. This shows that not enough people of color achieve the American Dream if we automatically make the thought of a happy white family. Jilani proves how stereotypes can affect a person’s life in a negative way and deter them from achieving the American Dream. To assist my view on this idea, Mary McMahon, author of the article “Effects of stereotypes on personal development”, believes that Stereotyping can influence people's education. She shows us how “In fact, stereotypical social roles continue to be passed down from generation to generation through differential socialization, especially traditional roles such as “mother and housewife” for women, and “father and provider” for men. Most of the time, adults are not even aware of these stereotypes as they educate their children”. McMahon believes that stereotypes are often taught at a young age. McMahon communicates that stereotyping can alter how children can look at themselves in the future, meaning that it may diminish their idea of what they wanna be as they grow up and become an adult. This author shows how stereotypes can make children lock on to one perspective of themselves and not look at other options they may want.
       Most Americans can not achieve the American Dream because they are being discriminated against by white people. This means the unjust or prejudicial treatment of different categories of people, especially on the grounds of ethnicity, age, sex, or disability. Joslyn Armstrong also explains how “Strain theory explains that experiences of discrimination and lower career attainment are causes of strain, dissatisfaction, or frustration that lead to African Americans’ inability to obtain the promises of The American Dream”. Armstrong believes that discrimination can cause a chain reaction and cause people to not achieve the American dream. Armstrong wants her readers to know that discrimination is one of the main reasons why the American dream is unattainable. Discrimination is a powerful tool that can make people's self-esteem go low enough that they give up hope of achieving their dreams. Armstrong also talks about how certain groups of people have a major block in their life. She believes that “A significant barrier to African American achievement and hard work is racial discrimination”. Armstrong tells us that one major setback to African American success is how others discriminate against their race. She believes that African Americans wouldn't be as troubled as they are now if people didn't discriminate against them. Armstrong opens a perspective on black communities and the troubles that the community goes through, proving how discrimination can be a major setback in achieving the American dream.
   What does a perfect life look like? Everyone has a different answer to that question. This shows a man living in the middle class with his family and the struggles they had to go through. This proves how they lived poorly. This shows how race can affect one's lifestyle and majorly affect their way of achieving the American Dream. This shows how race plays a huge part in how the American Dream is unattainable. Stereotyping can affect how a person achieves the American Dream by setting unjust opinions and ideas about a group of people. This shows that not enough people of color achieve the American Dream if we automatically make the thought of a happy white family. To Conclude, the American Dream cannot be achieved by everyone. Plus if the American Dream was achievable by everyone, then it would have lost all its worth and there would be no concept of “The American Dream”.
